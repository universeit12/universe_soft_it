  # the material Icons class.

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/
    - assets/images/offer/
    - assets/images/


  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: FontMain1
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/BebasNeue-Regular.ttf


    - family: FontMain2
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Teko-VariableFont_wght.ttf

    - family: FontMain3
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lobster-Regular.ttf

    - family: TextForm
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Courgette-Regular.ttf

    - family: FontMain4
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/DMSans-VariableFont_opsz,wght.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #   - family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
